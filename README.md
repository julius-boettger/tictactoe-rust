# Tic-Tac-Toe
### For your command line, written in Rust! Featuring...
- ðŸˆ³ Free choice of player symbols: Not just `X` and `O`, pick whatever unicode character you like!
- ðŸ§  A variable board size: Usually `3x3`, but why not go higher? `4x4`? Maybe even `10x10`? It's possible!
- ðŸŽ® More than two players: Enjoy it with your whole family!

> This is the first project I did for practice when learning Rust.
